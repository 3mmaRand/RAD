# Introduction

The Research Away on 22 September 2021 included breakout sessions that focussed on how to facilitate and improve research interactions between staff groups.  The break out sessions were introduced by Jillian Barlow, Emma Rand and Pen Holland who outlined some of the collaboratives projects they have been involved with. The slides for the introduction are here: [RAD Breakout](RAD Breakout.pdf)

Very many thanks to everyone for their willingness to contribute to discussions and especially to our group facilitators.

Feedback was received from `r groups` groups on three themes: `r resp`.


# Recommendations based on feedback

Proposed committee for consideration/action in brackets.

-  Arrange more random research and teaching events like the Away Day breakout sessions, to facilitate mixing across staff -  groups to brainstorm ideas and just chat. (DMT)
-  Review the induction and mentoring for new staff to facilitate more introductions and developing relationships across -  staff groups. (DMT)
-  Provide departmental pump priming to promote research and training interactions across groups developing new -  collaborations (could tie into the summer studentship scheme). (DRC)
-  Support and expand the summer studentship schemes for UG, including funding and training for post-docs to participate as -  supervisors, and inter/multi-disciplinary projects crossing staff/lab groups. (DRC, TC)
-  Develop structures by which post-docs can offer UG projects (especially stage 4 IM), with support from academic staff as a co-supervisor (ART or T&S), and recognition in workloads and pay (like GTA+ or contract variation). (DMT, TC)
-  Provide get-together sessions for e.g. all sci comm students and their directors, data science students and their -  directors, etc. (TC)
